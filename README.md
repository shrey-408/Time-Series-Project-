# Time-Series-Project-
he project aims to solve the problem of predicting commodity prices, which are influenced by global and local economic factors. The core goal is to develop a robust ARIMA/SARIMA-based forecasting model to predict future prices for commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products. The ultimate purpose is to provide traders reliable predictions.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust time-series forecasting model to predict future commodity prices. Using historical data, the model aims to capture underlying trends and seasonal fluctuations to provide accurate and actionable predictions. This is crucial for traders, investors, and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions in a volatile market.

## Objectives
* **Forecast Future Prices:** Build a reliable SARIMA-based model to predict prices for commodities (e.g., Gold, Oil, etc.).
* **Capture Trends and Seasonality:** Identify and model key patterns in historical price data.
* **Enable Data-Driven Decisions:** Provide stakeholders with timely and reliable forecasts.
* **Interactive User Input:** Allow users to dynamically select a commodity and receive a forecast with visualizations.
* **Evaluate Forecast Accuracy:** Measure model performance using standard metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Methodology
The project follows a standard time-series analysis methodology using Python libraries.
1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Historical commodity price data is loaded and cleaned.
2.  **Model Selection:** A Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is chosen for its ability to handle seasonality and trends.
3.  **Training & Forecasting:** The SARIMA model is trained on a portion of the historical data and then used to forecast future prices.
4.  **Evaluation:** The forecasted prices are compared against the actual data using RMSE and MAE to assess the model's accuracy.

## How to Use
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project requires standard data science libraries. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Run the notebook:**
    Open the `Pythoncode.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or a similar environment to run the code and generate the forecasts.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Pythoncode.ipynb
    ```

## Files in this Repository
* `Pythoncode.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data analysis, modeling, and forecasting.
* `data/`: A directory to store your historical commodity price data files (e.g., `gold_prices.csv`, `oil_prices.csv`).
* `README.md`: This file.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the average magnitude of the errors.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of the forecast errors without considering their direction.

These metrics provide a clear indication of the model's forecasting accuracy.
